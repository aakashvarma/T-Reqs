# T-Reqs

<p><img src="images/treqsimg.jpg" width="450" align="right">T-Reqs is a multi-language requirements file generator which also serves the purpose of preparing a template Dockerfile.  After a suggested preview, the developer should be ready to generate images for further work. Currently, the supported languages for the source file are Python and GO. It basically searches the entire app code file for the packages required, based upon the 'import' keyword. It writes the required dependencies on a requirements.txt file. Furthermore, the listed dependencies/packages are borrowed from the requirements file and are written on a template Dockerfile for further usage.  </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>This tool can prove to be really time-saving when you are working on a Docker application. You just need to have the app source coude file and the basic project directory will be created containing the required files. It is suggested that a preview is made before finalizing anything.</p>
